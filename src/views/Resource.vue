The organization collaborates with the media and legal practitioners and conducts desk research to identify and follow past incidents to report and document them. All data collected is thoroughly verified before being uploaded onto the project's database to ensure its accuracy and reliability. The database serves as a centralized source of information on incidents of arrests, assaults, attacks, seizures of equipment, restrictions on coverage, denial of access, and criminal charges against journalists or citizen bloggers in Nigeria."

It provides a centralized source of information on incidents of arrest, assault, attack, seizure of equipment, restrictions on coverage, denial of access, and criminal charges against journalists or citizen bloggers. This information can be used to advocate for greater press freedom and protections for journalists. It can also be used to hold government officials and law enforcement agencies accountable for any violations of press freedom or human rights. Additionally, the project database can serve as a resource for researchers, policymakers, and civil society organizations seeking to understand and address issues related to press freedom and the electoral process."
